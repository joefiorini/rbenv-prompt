# rbenv-prompt

Unicode prompty goodness for rbenv. This copies the unicode characters used in `rvm-prompt`. I plan to add a non-unicode option eventually, but if someone wants to send a pull request I'd be happy to accept!

## Install

You can install it using Homebrew via the command below. If someone wants to contribute a Homebrew formula to the main repo that would rock.

    brew install https://raw.github.com/joefiorini/homebrew/5ac0a1d8558c8a8334ce1e36114e82f6bb628e5e/Library/Formula/rbenv-prompt.rb
